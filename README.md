# Hi there! 👋

I’m a **software engineer** focused on building **developer-first tooling** that makes APIs more observable, reliable, and easier to work with.

I’m the creator of **WatchAPI** — a platform and VS Code–native tooling that helps teams **discover, monitor, and understand APIs directly from their code**, without relying on outdated specs or manual documentation.

My work centers on reducing friction in backend development by turning API structure, health, and behavior into something you can **see, track, and reason about** in real time.

## What I Do

- **API Observability:** Detect availability issues, latency spikes, and unexpected behavior before users notice.
- **Code-Native API Discovery:** Extract REST and tRPC endpoints directly from Next.js and backend codebases.
- **Developer Experience:** Eliminate context switching by bringing API insight into the editor and CI workflows.
- **Monitoring That Scales:** Designed for modern stacks, distributed systems, and fast-moving teams.

I believe APIs should be **transparent, predictable, and boring to operate**—and that the best monitoring tools stay out of the way while giving you confidence things are working.

🚀 Let’s make APIs observable by default.
